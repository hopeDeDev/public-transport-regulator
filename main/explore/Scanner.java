// comment out this whole code before running the Main code.
// these are some notes I made when learning the Scanner concept

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Scanner {
    // getting the user input object
    Scanner tool = new Scanner(System.in);
    // storing the user input according to its type
    int passengers = tool.nextInt();
    // prompt message to the user
        System.out.println("How many passengers?");
    // final output to the user after
        System.out.println("The number of passengers are " + passengers);
